## Example Repos

Repos come in all shapes and sizes, with many different organization forms. Poke around on some of these repositories below to get a feel for the variation of structure, and check on the commits to see what changes happen big and small. You won't break anything, we promise.

These repositories are in no particular order and we recommend at least glancing at them all.

A. ebullient's [TTRPG-CLI Repo](https://github.com/ebullient/ttrpg-convert-cli)
B. Obsidian [Developer Docs Repo](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-developer-docs)
C. Obsidian [Tasks Repo](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks)
D. SlRvb's ITS [Theme Repo](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme)
E. Plotto, A [Repo for Fiction](https://github.com/garykac/plotto).
F. Awesome [Repositories List Repo](https://github.com/pawelborkar/awesome-repos)

## Git

Now that you have seen some repos, let's talk about why we have them.

As a TTRPG player or game master, utilizing Git and Github can be a game-changer when it comes to keeping track of your files, images, plugins, and general backups. It's the ultimate tool for managing everything in a collaborative setting.

### Backups

Before I started using Git and syncing services like Obsidian Sync, I used to spend hours emailing myself backups of everything. But it was such a hassle, and there was this one time I forgot to email myself a backup and ended up losing all my hard work. Talk about a nightmare. With Git, you don't have to worry about that anymore. It keeps track of all your changes and saves them automatically, so you can rest easy knowing your work is safe.

### Collaboration

Working with other game masters can be a pain when it comes to merging changes and edits. You might be using a word doc and track changes, but that's messy and not very efficient. Git, on the other hand, makes collaboration a breeze. It creates multiple points of file history and saving by default, so you and your collaborators can easily merge changes and keep track of who did what. Plus, you can always revert changes across multiple files in one go, without losing any of your hard work. And if you have great ideas that don't make it into the final version of your project, you can always keep them in your fork for future use.

## Github

Github is like a social network for programmers, but instead of sharing cat memes and vacation photos, people share their code which produces cat memes and vacation photos. You can see what others are working on and browse their code to offer suggestions or make changes. The best part? Github makes it easy to study code since you can inspect all the code and its entire history.

### There's Something for Everyone

Github is perfect for collaboration because it makes it easy to offer suggested changes to others' code or files. Even if you're not a coding genius, you can still contribute. For example, I was able to take on multiple documentation projects because I'm somewhat organized and can write in English. I also made some small quality-of-life changes to Obsidian Admonitions because I know a bit of CSS. You don't need to be a coding expert to be helpful.

### Simplified Hosting

One of the biggest benefits of using Github is that you don't have to go through the hassle of setting up your own Git server. Github provides all the hosting you need, so you can focus on developing and collaborating on your data. This means less time spent worrying about server setup and maintenance and more time spent making progress on your projects.
