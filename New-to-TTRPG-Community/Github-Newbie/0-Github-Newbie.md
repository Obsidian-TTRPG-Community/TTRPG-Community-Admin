Although it may seem daunting at first, I hope to provide you with a beginner-friendly guide to get started.

Git and GitHub are essential tools for version control, allowing you to keep track of changes in your code and collaborate with others seamlessly. With minimal effort, you can set up an account on GitHub, install git, and start using it for your TTRPG projects.

Here are some things you can do with git and github:

-   Create a new repository from scratch or with an existing project.

-   Fork someone's repository to contribute to their project.
-   Handle merge conflicts and fix incorrect commit messages.
-   Explore the code and its history using tags and diffs.
-   Create branches and merge them as needed.
-   Delete a repository when you're done with it.
